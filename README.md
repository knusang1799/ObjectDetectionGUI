# Easy TensorFlow Object Detection API GUI for anyone
Easy to use, Good looking, Highly utilized, and Light Tensorflow Tool.\
TensorFlow with user friendly GRAphical Framework for object detection API (TF-GraF) allows anyone, even without any previous knowledge of deep learning frameworks, to design, train and deploy machine intelligence models without coding.\
No need to Code! NO need type Command line!\
All you need to do is download exe file and go!\
